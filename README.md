# Crypto Clustering


## Synopsis

Utilized Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7 days price changes.

## Hypothesis

Cryptocurrencies will more affected by 24-hour price changes than 7 days.

## Data Preperation 
Prepared by applying the StandScaler module from the scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file.

## Conclusion

The dataset displayed that cryptocurrencies were affected by 24-hour price changes than 7 days. Cyptocurrencies have a less steep curve over a 7 day period than a 24-hour timeframe.
